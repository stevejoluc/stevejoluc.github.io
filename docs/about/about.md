Hello, my name is Steven, and I am a technical leader with a passion for technology and people. To help you understand who I am, I will summarize my strengths into three buckets; leadership, learning agility, and developing others.

## Leadership

This background has helped instill me with leadership values such as; team work, the ability to adapt, and finding strategic solutions to problems. Throughout my life I have always gravitated toward a leadership role. Whether it has been Team Captain for soccer or a Product Owner at State Farm. Being a leader has always been part of who I am. It also provides me with what I find most rewarding; coaching, motivating and empowering my peers.
