Hello, my name is Steven. I am an Cloud FinOps Data Analyst with a passion for technology and business. To help you understand who I am, I will summarize my strengths into three buckets; **leadership**, **developing others**, and being a **continuous learner**.

I come from a family that has a deep history of being first responders and serving our country. This background has helped instill me with leadership values such as; team work, the ability to adapt, and finding strategic solutions to problems. Throughout my life I have always gravitated toward a leadership role. Whether it has been Team Captain for soccer or a technology leader at State Farm. Being a leader has always been part of who I am. It provides me with what I find most rewarding; coaching, motivating and empowering my peers.
