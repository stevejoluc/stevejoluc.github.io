## Introduction
Hello, my name is Steven. I am a natural leader who is passionate about about technology and people. I approach each day with a growth mindset; this has taught me to not be afraid of change, but to embrace it. I take pride in being a **continuous learner**, **identifying opportunities to grow**, and **always challenging the status quo**.
