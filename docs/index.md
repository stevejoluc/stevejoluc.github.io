## Introduction
My name is Steven. I am known to be a natural leader who is passionate about about technology and people. I approach each day with a growth mindset; this has taught me to not be afraid of change, but to embrace it. I take pride in being a continuous learner, identifying opportunities to grow, and always challenging the status quo.
